# Portfolio

## Description
For this project I designed a professional and simple website that responds to user when clicking on links on the navbar as well as the bottom of the page. This website was established with the intent that potential future empoloyers can refer to this project to get to know me better and view the work I have accomplished

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

All that has to be done to utilize this page is to open the page and from there the user may either click the internal links located at the nav bar or simply scroll. This project displays a quick summary to get to know me, work that I have designed, as well as ways to contact me.
